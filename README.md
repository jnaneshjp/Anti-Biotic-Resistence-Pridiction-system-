# Anti-Biotic-Resistence-Pridiction-system-
This project uses a Random Forest classifier to predict antimicrobial resistance from high-dimensional genomic data. Genomic sequences are converted into a gene presence-absence matrix, enabling effective learning of gene–resistance patterns and robust evaluation using accuracy and F1-scor
